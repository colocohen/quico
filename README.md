## ✨ Features
- **Pure JS QUIC**: Initial & 1-RTT packets, connection ID management, ACK & flow-control.
- **TLS 1.3 handshake** in JavaScript (no OpenSSL binding).
- **HTTP/3** control stream, request/response, server push, GOAWAY.
- **WebTransport** streams & datagrams (RFC 9298) — tested with Chrome Canary.
- **QPACK** encoder/decoder with custom Huffman table support.
- Fully self-contained—no native addons, no external OpenSSL.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install quico
```

## 🏃 Quick start

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const quico = require('quico');

const server = quico.createServer({
  SNICallback: function (servername, cb) {
    cb(null, {
      key: fs.readFileSync('certs/localhost.key'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('certs/localhost.crt')
    });
  }
}, function (req, res) {
  const data = new TextEncoder().encode('Hello World from HTTP/3 on Node.js!');
  res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8',
    'Content-Length': data.byteLength
  });
  res.end(data);
});

server.listen(4433, function () {
  console.log('🚀 QUIC server running on https://localhost:4433');
});
```

## 🧪 Testing

QUIC requires **TLS 1.3 with an ECDSA certificate**.
RSA self-signed certificates usually fail with QUIC/HTTP3.
For local development the easiest option is [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert),
which generates locally trusted ECDSA certificates automatically.

This project supports ALPN `"h3"` only
(final version, not draft variants like `h3-29` or `h3-32`).
You must explicitly force h3 when testing.

> ✅ Launch Chrome with:
> `--enable-quic --quic-version=h3 --ignore-certificate-errors --origin-to-force-quic-on=localhost:4433`
>
> ✅ Or test with Curl:
> `curl --http3 -vvv --trace-time --trace-ascii - https://localhost:4433 --insecure`


## 🛣 Roadmap

The following roadmap reflects the current and planned status of the QUICO project.  
✅ = Completed 🔄 = In progress ⏳ = Planned ❌ = Not planned

### ✅ Completed
| Status | Item |
|:------:|------|
| ✅ | QUIC: Initial / Handshake / 1-RTT |
| ✅ | TLS 1.3 handshake & key schedule |
| ✅ | HTTP/3: control streams & basic requests |
| ✅ | QPACK: static & dynamic table |

### 🔄 In Progress
| Status | Item | Notes |
|:------:|------|-------|
| 🔄 | QPACK: Huffman encoding/decoding | Custom table support partially working |
| 🔄 | WebTransport: unidirectional & bidirectional streams | Stream interface WIP |
| 🔄 | HTTP/3: GOAWAY & request cancellation | Partial control flow support |
| 🔄 | Integration with Node.js `https`-style API | Goal: seamless compatibility |
| 🔄 | Project modularization & internal refactoring | To improve maintainability |

### ⏳ Planned
| Status | Item | Notes |
|:------:|------|-------|
| ⏳ | QUIC: 0-RTT support | Will follow key update & early data support |
| ⏳ | WebTransport: datagram support | Based on RFC 9298 |
| ⏳ | QUIC: proper connection teardown | CLOSE frame, idle timeout |
| ⏳ | QUIC: keep-alive & PING frames | For long-lived connections |
| ⏳ | QUIC: flow control & congestion (BBR / CUBIC) | Needs metrics and simulation |
| ⏳ | QUIC: session resumption & connection migration | For mobile/roaming support |
| ⏳ | End-to-end test suite against Chromium | Automate using testh3 and Puppeteer |
| ⏳ | Benchmarks, performance analysis & tuning | Resource usage, latency, throughput |
| ⏳ | Fuzz testing and protocol robustness checks | To improve security and reliability |
| ⏳ | Developer documentation & API reference | For better onboarding |
| ⏳ | TypeScript typings | Type safety for IDE support |

_Note: QUICO is a work-in-progress project aiming to provide a full JavaScript implementation of QUIC + HTTP/3. Community contributions are welcome!_

# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to the **Quico** project.

Quico is a collaborative open-source project built by developers who share an interest in high-quality networking software.  
To keep our work environment professional, open, and constructive, we ask everyone involved to follow a few simple principles.


## Our Principles

- **Be respectful and professional.**  
  Treat others with respect in all discussions, issues, and pull requests.  
  Personal attacks, offensive language, or hostile behavior are not acceptable.

- **Be constructive.**  
  Offer feedback that helps improve the project.  
  Critique code, not people. Assume good intentions.

- **Be clear.**  
  Write issues, comments, and documentation in a way others can understand.  
  Remember that contributors may come from different backgrounds or languages.

- **Be collaborative.**  
  Help others, share knowledge, and recognize contributions.

- **When disagreements happen, stay focused on the technical solution.**  
  It’s fine to disagree — what matters is finding the best outcome for the project.


## Reporting

If you notice behavior that violates this Code of Conduct,  
please report it privately to [support@quicojs.dev](mailto:support@quicojs.dev).
